# scroll-scope.js 0.1.0

Small JS plugin to keep parent elements still when scrolling an element past their boundaries. Simple fix to a problem that shouldn't exist.

Demos at [eiskis.net/scroll-scope](http://eiskis.net/scroll-scope), source at [GitHub](https://github.com/Eiskis/scroll-scope).



## Get it

Download:

- [scroll-scope.min.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Eiskis/scroll-scope/master/scroll-scope.min.js) for production
- [scroll-scope.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Eiskis/scroll-scope/master/scroll-scope.js) for development

Install with Bower:

```sh
bower install scroll-scope
```



## Usage

Add the `data-scroll="scope"` attribute to any scrollable element on the page.

```html
<div class="my-scrollable-element" data-scroll="scope">
```

Include and initialize plugin:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.4.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="scroll-scope.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
	$(document).scrollScope();
</script>
```

The plugin attaches itself to the document object (or any parent container you choose), so you don't need to bind it for any new scrollable elements you might load via AJAX or otherwise insert into the DOM after initialization.



### Options

By default, `data-scroll="scope"` elements are targeted, but you can choose this upon initialization:

```js
$(document).scrollScope('.results, .some-scrollable-element');
```

By default, the plugin catches the events <code>DOMMouseScroll mousewheel</code>, but you can choose this upon initialization:

```js
$(document).scrollScope(null, 'DOMMouseScroll mousewheel my:event');
```
